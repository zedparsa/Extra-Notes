 </div>
 
**Parsa:**  
> RMP stands for **Remote Management Protocol**. It refers to tools that let you access and control your device remotely — without needing to be physically near it.

> Hmmm, I think I get it. Can you give me an example?
 </div>
 
**Parsa:**
> Of course! Have you ever lost your TV remote? When that happens, you have to get close to the TV and press the buttons directly — right? But when you use a remote control, you can operate the TV from across the room.  
In the same way, **RMPs** let you control your network devices from a distance.
