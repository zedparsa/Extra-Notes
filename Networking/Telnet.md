### 🗣️ Telnet — Dialog Style

**Parsa:** 
> Telnet, or *Telecommunication Network*, is a type of **RMP**.

🗨 <div align="right"><strong>:Yazdan</strong>
 > What’s RMP?  
 </div>
 
**Parsa:**  
> RMP stands for **Remote Management Protocol**. It refers to tools that let you access and control your device remotely — without needing to be physically near it.

 🗨 <div align="right"><strong>:Yazdan</strong>
> Hmmm, I think I get it. Can you give me an example?
 </div>
 
**Parsa:**
> Of course! Have you ever lost your TV remote? When that happens, you have to get close to the TV and press the buttons directly — right? But when you use a remote control, you can operate the TV from across the room.  
In the same way, **RMPs** let you control your network devices from a distance.

> Nice! Tell me more about Telnet.

**Parsa:** 
> Absolutely.

## 🧠 Telnet (Telecommunication Network)

### 🧩 Simple Definition

**Telnet** is a remote communication protocol that allows you to access and control a network device (like a router or switch) using a command-line interface — from anywhere, without needing to physically touch the device.

### 🔍 Let's Get Deep into Telnet

When you use Telnet to access a network device, here's what happens step-by-step across the **TCP/IP layers**:

1. **Application Layer** — The Telnet protocol is triggered by the client to initiate a remote session.
2. **Transport Layer** — A TCP connection is established to the destination device on **port 23**.
3. **Network Layer** — The data is wrapped into IP packets with the **destination IP address**.
4. **Data Link Layer** — The packets are framed with the **MAC address** of the next-hop device (like a router or switch).
5. **Physical Layer** — The frames are converted into electrical signals or radio waves and physically transmitted through a **cable or wireless medium**.

✏ So, **Telnet is considered an Application Layer protocol**, but it relies on all lower layers to actually transmit the data across the network.



### 🧠 Why Does It Matter?

- 🔹 **Remote Management**: It lets you configure devices over the network — like routers, switches, or servers — without being physically near them.
- 🔹 **Historical Importance**: Telnet was one of the first ways to manage systems remotely over TCP/IP.
- 🔹 **Foundation for SSH**: Modern secure protocols like SSH were designed as improvements over Telnet.



### ⚙️ How It Works (Conceptually)

1. A device (like your PC) initiates a Telnet session to another device using its IP address and **port 23**.
2. If the destination device has Telnet enabled and accessible, it opens a **VTY (virtual terminal) line** for communication.
3. From there, you type commands and receive output — just like you're sitting at the device's console.

Behind the scenes:
- It's **text-based**
- Uses **TCP** as transport (reliable delivery)
- Everything — including passwords — is sent as **plain text** (⚠️ insecure)

### 🔐 Real-World Use Cases

- ✅ **Managing Cisco Routers or Switches in Labs** — great for beginners practicing basic device configuration.
- ✅ **Accessing Legacy Systems** — some older systems still rely on Telnet for remote access.
- ✅ **Network Troubleshooting in Isolated Environments** — like test environments without security concerns.



### 📦 Example

Imagine you want to configure a router from your laptop, but the router is in another room.

```text
Your Laptop    ────── Telnet ──────>    Router (192.168.1.1)
```
```
telnet 192.168.1.1
```
